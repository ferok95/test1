# Git init

## Introduction

`git init`` is a command that creates an empty Git repository or reinitializes an existing one. It has various options to customize the initial branch, object format, template files, and repository permissions. It can be run in a bare or non-bare repository, and it can use a template directory or a template file.

## Steps
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new Git repository.
3. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

```
git init
```
4. You should see a message that says "Initialized empty Git repository in [directory]".
5. You can now start adding files to your new Git repository and committing changes.
