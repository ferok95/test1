# Git status
## Intro
`git status` is a command that displays the status of the working tree and the staging area in a Git repository. It shows the differences between the working tree and the index file, the differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, and the untracked files in the working tree. The command has various options to customize the output format, verbosity, and handling of submodules
## Steps
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Git repository is located.
3. Run the following command to view the status of your repository:
```
git status
```
4. Git will show you a list of modified files, staged files, and untracked files.
5. If you want to see more detailed information about the changes, you can use the `git diff` command.
6. If you want to stage changes for commit, you can use the `git add` command.
7. Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them using the `git commit` command.
